    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> 3<sup>th</sup>
        standard dummy text ever since the <u><i><strong>1500s</strong></i></u>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into  <em>electronic typesetting</em> ,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus  <mark>PageMaker includin</mark> versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
